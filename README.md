# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a basic two-player game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Basics

Player 1 enters the game via localhost:3000/player1, or by clicking the appropriate button on the home page. Player 2 enters the game in the same way. The game waits for both players to enter before starting the game and letting the players make their choices.

Unlike some other games of Rock, Paper, Scissors, this one can continue indefinitely (or until someone resets the meteor server). At each round, the game will wait for both players to make their choices before reporting the result and adding to each player's score.
